# Cab Fare Prediction - Regression
This is a prediction machine learning model. In this project, my objective was to predict the fare of a cab based on time and daytime variance. I applied data cleaning, calculating the distance between the source and the destination. I implemented some ML regression algorithms and tested the score of the model


# Steps:
  - Import Libraries and read data set
  - Describe the dataset
  - Handling Missing Values
  - Data Transforamtion / Categorical to Numerical
  - Data Cleaning and Feature Selection
  - Split the dataset into train and test set
  - Machine Learning Modeling
  - train the model (Fit)
  - Test the trained model (prediction )
  - Model Evaluation
